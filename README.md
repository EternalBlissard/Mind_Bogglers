## Introduction
Developed a website for recommending books to users based on reviews using collaborative filtering.

## Problem Statement
Currently, a product with a 5-star rating from 10 customers provides less reliable information than one with a 4.8-star rating from 1000 users, as a larger number of reviews offers a more comprehensive perspective. To address this issue, we have developed a collaborative filtering model that allows users to filter similar products based on minimum review counts and to only consider ratings from users who have provided at least a specified number of reviews.
